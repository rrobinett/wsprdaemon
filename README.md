# WsprDaemon (WD) 3.2.3 is the current master version

Wsprdaemon (WD) is Linux service which decodes WSPR and FST4W spots from one or more [Kiwis](http://kiwisdr.com) and/or RX888 SDRs and *reliably* posts them to [wsprnet.org](http://wsprnet.org).  It includes many features not found in WSJT-x, including multiple band and/or multiple receiver support.  WD also records additional information about spots like doppler shift and background noise level which permit much deeper understanding of propagation conditions.  For systems like the KiwiSDR which have a limited number of receive channels, schedules can be configured to switch between bands at different hours of the day or at sunrise/sunset-relative times. Spots obtained from multiple receivers on the same band ( e.g a 40M vertical and 500' Beverage ) can be merged together with only the best SNR posted to [wsprnet.org](http://wsprnet.org).  WD can be configured to create graphs of the background noise level for display locally and/or at [graphs.wsprdaemon.org](http://graphs.wsprdaemon.org) or [wspr.live](http://wspr.live/gui/). 

After configuration, WD is designed to run like a home appliance: it recovers on its own from power and Internet outages and caches all spots and other data it gathers until it is confirmed delivered by wsprnet.org and/or wsprdaemon.net.  Most of the 20+ 'top spotting' sites at http://wspr.rocks/topspotters/ are running WD, and in aggregate they report about 33% of the 7+M spots recorded each day at wsprnet.org. 

For further documentation on prerequisites, installation, configuration, and running WD, please refer to the [documentation](https://wsprdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.1/).
