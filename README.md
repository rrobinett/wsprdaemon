# WsprDaemon (WD) 3.2.3 is the current master version

Wsprdaemon (WD) runs as a Linux service to decode WSPR and FST4W spots from one or more [Kiwis](http://kiwisdr.com) and/or RX888 SDRs and *reliably* post them to [wsprnet.org](http://wsprnet.org).  It includes many features not found in WSJT-x, including multiple band and/or multiple receiver support.  WD also records additional information about spots like doppler shift and background noise level which permit much deeper understanding of propagation conditions.  For systems like the KiwiSDR which have a limited number of receive channels, schedules can be configured to switch between bands at different hours of the day or at sunrise/sunset-relative times. It can "merge" spots obtained from multiple receivers on the same band (e.g a 40M vertical and 500' Beverage) and report only the one with the best SNR to [wsprnet.org](http://wsprnet.org).  WD can create graphs of the background noise level for display locally and/or at [graphs.wsprdaemon.org](http://graphs.wsprdaemon.org) or [wspr.live](http://wspr.live/gui/). 

After configuration, WD runs like a home appliance: it recovers on its own from power and Internet outages and caches all spots and other data it gathers until it confirms delivered to wsprnet.org and/or wsprdaemon.net.  Most of the 20+ 'top spotting' sites at http://wspr.rocks/topspotters/ run WD, and in aggregate they report about 33% of the 7+M spots recorded each day at wsprnet.org. 

For further documentation on prerequisites, installation, configuration, and running WD, please refer to the [documentation](https://wsprdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.1/).
