##########################################################################################################################################################

### We cache spots and noise data under ~/wsprdaemon/.. Three upload daemons run at second 110:
### 1)  Upload spots to wsprnet.org using the curl MEPT bulk transfer method
### 2)  Upload those same spots to logs.wsprdaemon.org using 'curl ...'
### 3)  Upload noise level data to logs.wsprdaemon.org using 'curl ...'

###### uploading to wsprnet.org
### By consolidating spots for all bands of each CALL/GRID into one curl MEPT upload, we dramatically increase the efficiency of the upload for 
### both the Pi and wsprnet.org while also ensuring that when we view the wsprnet.org database sorted by CALL and TIME, the spots for
### each 2 minute cycle are displayed in ascending or descending frequency order.
### To achieve that:
### Wait for all of the CALL/GRID/BAND jobs in a two minute cycle to complete, 
###    then cat all of the wspr_spot.txt files together and sort them into a single file in time->freq order
### The posting daemons put the spots.txt files in ${UPLOADS_WSPRNET_ROOT_DIR}/CALL/..
### There is a potential problem in the way I've implemented this algorithm:
###   If all of the wsprds don't complete their decoding in the 2 minute WSPR cycle, then those tardy band results will be delayed until the following upload
###   I haven't seen that problem and if it occurs the only side effect is that a time sorted display of the wsprnet.org database may have bands that don't
###   print out in ascending frequency order for that 2 minute cycle.  Avoiding that unlikely and in any case lossless event would require a lot more logic
###   in the upload_to_wsprnet_daemon() and I would rather work on VHF/UHF support

### The spot and noise data is saved in permanent file systems, while temp files are not saved
