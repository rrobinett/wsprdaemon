wsprdaemon depends heavily upon the 'wsprd' program and other technologies developed by Joe Taylor K1JT and others, to whom we are grateful.

"

### This bash script logs WSPR spots from one or more Kiwi
### It differs from the autowspr mode built in to the Kiwi by:
### 1) Processing the uncompressed audio .wav file through the 'wsprd' utility program supplied as part of the WSJT-x distribution
###    The latest 'wsprd' includes algorithmic improvements over the version included in the Kiwi
### 2) Executing 'wsprd -d', a deep search mode which sometimes detects 10% more signals in the .wav file
### 3) By executing on a more powerful CPU than the single core ARM in the Beaglebone, many more signals are extracted on busy WSPR bands,'
###    e.g. 20M during daylight hours
###
###  This script depends extensively upon the 'kiwirecorder.py' utility developed by John Seamons, the Kiwi author
###  I owe him much thanks for his encouragement and support 
###  Feel free to email me with questions or problems at:  rob@robinett.us
###  This script was originally developed on Mac OSX, but this version 0.1 has been tested only on the Raspberry Pi 3b+
###  On the 3b+ I am easily running 6 simultaneous WSPR decode sessions and expect to be able to run 12 sessions covering all the 
###  LF/MF/HF WSPR bands on one Pi
