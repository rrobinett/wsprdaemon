# Overview of Configuration 

Having prepared and cloned the wsprdaemon software, now you can run it:

```
wd
```
This sets the stage and tells you to edit wsprdaemon.conf.

## wsprdaemon.conf

The template for a wsprdaemon.conf file includes tons of stuff and looks dauntingly complicated. 
However, it boils down to setting up the following:
- [computer-related parameters](./computer.md)
- [receiver definitions](./receivers.md)
- [ka9q-radio parameters](./ka9q-radio.md)
- [reporting parameters](./reporting.md)
- [a schedule](./schedule.md)

## radiod@.conf

Likewise, the radiod@<something>.conf has lots of options.
However, it boils down to setting up the following:
- [global settings](./radiod_conf/global.md)
- [hardware settings](./radiod_conf/hardware.md)
- [channel settings](./radiod_conf/channels.md)
