# ka9q-web 

This software builds in reference to ka9q-radio and requires no specific configuration.  

John Melton G0ORX started this with a proof-of-concept version in late 2023. This adjunct to ka9q-radio displays a spectrum, waterfall, and other data from radiod.  Scott Newell N5TNL has since improved it dramatically in collaboration with Rob Robinett AI6VN, Phil Karn KA9Q, Glenn Elmore N6GN, Jim Lill WA2ZKD, and desultory kibbitzers.
