# WSPR spots

WSPR, which stands for Weak Signal Propagation Reporter, is a protocol used in amateur radio for assessing radio signal propagation. It allows users to send and receive very low-power transmissions over long distances, which are then automatically reported by receiving stations. Here are some key points about WSPR:

**Purpose**: WSPR is primarily used for scientific and testing purposes, helping amateur radio operators analyze radio wave propagation conditions.

**Operation**: WSPR operates on specific frequencies and uses a special encoding method for its transmissions. Unlike traditional radio communication, WSPR does not support two-way conversations; it focuses on sending short, beacon-like signals.

**Implementation**: The WSPR protocol can be implemented in software, and it is compatible with various hardware setups, making it accessible for many amateur radio operators.

**Community and Reporting**: WSPR signals are often received by automated software-defined radio (SDR) receivers, which can report back the signal's strength and other details via the Internet, contributing to a global database of propagation conditions.

## WSPRnet

The Weak Signal Propagation Reporter Network is a group of amateur radio operators using K1JT's MEPT_JT digital mode to probe radio frequency propagation conditions using very low power (QRP/QRPp) transmissions. The software is open source, and the data collected are available to the public through [this site](https://wsprnet.org/).
