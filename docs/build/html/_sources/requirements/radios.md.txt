### RX888

The RX888 connects to your computer via a USB 3 -- SuperSpeed connection.  These typically have a BLUE tab on the computer socket as distinct from the white or black for USB 2. 

As delivered the RX888 has sub-optimal thermal protection and for radio science applications it needs an external GPS DO 27 MHz clock.

Paul WB6CXC created a screwdriver-only kit which enhances the thermal protection and adds a ground-isolated external clock SMA input port. Paul describes the installation and use of his kit on [his website](https://turnislandsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RX888-Kit-2.pdf)

The kit is available at [the TAPR web store](https://tapr.org/product/rx888-clock-kit-and-thermal-pad/).
