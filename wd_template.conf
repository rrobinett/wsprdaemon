#### The previous line signals to the vim editor that it should use its 'bash' editing mode when editing this file

### To enable the configuration values in this file, modify the line and remove the leading '#'
### Two arrays must be defined in this file:    RECEIVER_LIST and WSPR_SCHEDULE, the rest are optional

################### These are diagnostic and debugging variables which  should not be needed or used in normal configurations ###################

### To more easily support installation and debugging of WD user sites, a user can enable a very secure remote access channel to their WD server
### To enable such a channel, contact Rob by emailing rob@robinett.us to obtain a REMOTE_ACCESS_CHANNEL and a REMOTE_ACCESS_ID
### Rob will also need the user and password for the account running WD on your WD server 
### Please change these values before uncommenting them:
# REMOTE_ACCESS_CHANNEL=99
# REMOTE_ACCESS_ID="AI6VN"

### In CPU constrained installations, less CPU will be used if the 'wsprd' command is instructed to search less deeply for spots.
### That can be done by uncommenting the following line and changing '-o 4' (the value used by WSJT-x) to '-o 3', '-o 2' or even '-o 1'
### However if your site requires '-o 2' or '-o 1', then you are missing a significant number of spots and should consider upgrading your WD server to one with a more powerful CPU
# WSPRD_CMD_FLAGS="-C 500 -o 4 -d"

### Unlike WSJT-x, WD doesn't upload spots with the same WSPR cycle time, band and beacon call sign.  By suppressing such 'duplicates' WD remove reports generated by by the sidebands of very strong signals (i.e. > +20 dB SNR)
### That suppression can be disabled by uncommenting this line:
# RECORD_DUPLICATE_SPOTS="yes"

### Starting in WD 3.0.3.3, when ARCHIVE_WAV_FILES="yes" is defnied in wsprdaemon.conf a currently running WD client will cache all wav files after they are decoded and
### queued for posting to wsprnet.org.  When so enabled, each odd two minute WD stores all of the currently cached wav files into a single compressed tar file in
### ~/wsprdaemon/wav-archive.d/....  That tar file's name is derived from the WD client's site name, maidenhead, and date with the file name extension .tar.zst
### For example, at KFS the file 'KFS_CM87tj_220805_0808.tar.zst' contains a group of wav files the most recent of which recorded the WSPR cycle which started at
### Aug 5, 2022 at 08:08 UDT. In almost all cases all of the wav files in such a tar file come from the same WSPR cycle.
### Since these wav files are uncompressed audio they are quite large.  A 30 minute wav file which might contain a FST4W-1800 signal will be almost 50 MBytes.
### To avoid overflowing the ~/wsprdaemon/wav-archive.d file system, if that wave file will fill more thanb 75% of the file system, then some of the oldest wav files are deleted first
# ARCHIVE_WAV_FILES="yes"

###################  The following variables are used in normally running installations ###################
# SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD="no"           ### Whether and how to upload extended spots to wsprdaemon.org.  WD always attempts to upload spots to wsprnet.org
                                    ### SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD="no"         => (Default) Only upload spots directly to wsprnet.org
                                    ### SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_MODE="noise" => In addition, upload extended spots and noise data to wsprdaemon.org
                                    ### SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_MODE="proxy" => Don't directly upload spots to wsprdaemon.org.  Instead, after uploading extended spots and noise data to wsprdaemon.org have it regenerate and upload those spots to wsprnet.org
                                    ###                                     This mode minimizes the use of Internet bandwidth, but makes getting spots to wsprnet.org dependent upon the wsprdameon.org services.

# If SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD in NOT "no", then you must modify SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_ID from "AI6VN" to your call sign.  SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_ID cannot include '/
# SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_ID="AI6VN"     ### The name put in upload log records, the title bar of the graph, and the name used to view spots and noise at that server.
# SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_GRAPHS="yes"   ### If this variable is defined as "yes" AND SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_ID is defined, then FTP graphs of the last 24 hours to http://wsprdaemon.org/graphs/SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_ID
# SIGNAL_LEVEL_LOCAL_GRAPHS="yes"    ### If this variable is defined as "yes" AND SIGNAL_LEVEL_UPLOAD_ID is defined, then make graphs visible at http://localhost/
#
### Graphs  default to y-axis minimum of -175 dB to maximum of -105 dB.  X pixels default to 40, Y pixels default to 30.  If the graph of your system isn't pleasing, you can change the graph's appearance by
### uncommenting one or more of these variables and changing their values
# NOISE_GRAPHS_Y_MIN=-175
# NOISE_GRAPHS_Y_MAX=-105
# NOISE_GRAPHS_X_PIXEL=40
# NOISE_GRAPHS_Y_PIXEL=30

### The RECEIVER_LIST() array defines the physical (KIWI_xxx,AUDIO_xxx,SDR_xxx) and logical (MERG...) receive devices available on this server
### Each element of RECEIVER_LIST is a string with 5 space-separated fields:
###   " ID(no spaces)             IP:PORT or RTL:n    MyCall       MyGrid  KiwPassword    Optional SIGNAL_LEVEL_ADJUSTMENTS
###                                                                                       [[DEFAULT:ADJUST,]BAND_0:ADJUST[,BAND_N:ADJUST_N]...]
###                                                                                       A comma-separated list of BAND:ADJUST pairs
###                                                                                       BAND is one of 2200..10, while ADJUST is in dBs TO BE ADDED to the raw data 
###                                                                                       So If you have a +10 dB LNA, ADJUST '-10' will LOWER the reported level so that your reports reflect the level at the input of the LNA
###                                                                                       DEFAULT defaults to zero and is applied to all bands not specified with a BAND:ADJUST

)

### The WSPR_SCHEDULE[] array (table) defines a schedule of configurations which will applied by WD's  watchdog daemon when it runs every odd two minutes
### The first field of each entry is the start time for the configuration defined in the following fields
### Start time is in the format HH:MM (e.g 13:15) and by default is in the time zone of the host server '01:30'
### Start times can also be specified by 'sunrise' or 'sunset' followed optionally by "+HH:MM" or "-HH:MM" e.g. "sunrise+01:00"
### Schedules are referenced to the time zone of the host server.  So if your server is set to 'America/New_York', then the entry times are for EST/EDT
### There is no need to define an schedule for time '00:00'
### If the time of the first entry is not 00:00, then the latest entry (which may not necessarily be the last ) will be applied at time 00:00

### Following the time are one or more fields of the format 'RECEIVER,BAND[,MODE_1[:MODE_2[:...]]'
### The value of RECEIVER must match one of the receivers defined in RECEIVER_LIST[]

### The value of BAND must match one of:
### WSPR bands:            2200 630 160 80 80eu 60 60eu 40 30 22 20 17 15 12 10 6 4 2 1 0
### Noise only bands:      WWVB WWV_2_5 WWV_5 WWV_10 WWV_15 WWV_20 WWV_25 CHU_3 CHU_7 CHU_14

### The optional 'MODE' arguments specify one or more packet decode modes:
###    WO     => for the 'Noise only' bands, which runs the 'wsprd' decoder in its fastest to run mode.  This mode cannot be specified with the other modes
###    W2     => legacy WSPR 2 minute mode (the default if no modes are specified)
###    F2     => FST4W-120  (2 minute) 
###    F5     => FST4W-300  (5 minute)
###    F15    => FST4W-900  (15 minue)
###    F30    => FST4W-1800 (30 minute)
###  For example "00:00   KIWI_0,630,W2:F2:F5  AI6VN"   specifies that KIWI_0 should tune to 630M and decode WSPR-2,FST4W-120, and FST4W-300 mode packets
###  Specifying additional modes will add to the CPU burden of the sysem and even more significantly to the peak usage of the /tmp/wsprdaemon tmpfd (ramdisk) file system
###  In 3.0.2.4 and later, WD calculates the peak usages of the /tmp/wsprdaemon file system and warns if that file system may overflow.
###  For FST4W modes spectral width estimation is enabled and is available in the wsprdaemon_spots_s table in database tutorial on wd3.wsprdaemon.org as 'metric'

### So the form of each line is  "HH:MM   RECEIVER,BAND[,MODE_1[:Mode2[...]]... ".  Here are some examples:
